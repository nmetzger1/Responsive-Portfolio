			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p class="aboutme">
				After growing up in northern Ohio, I came to Orlando, FL for what was supposed to be an eight month stint as an employee of Walt Disney World. However, after meeting my future wife and deciding I wanted a break from long winters, I decided to make my permanent residence in the 'Sunshine State'.
			</p>
			<p class="aboutme">
				After bouncing around from job to job, I stumbled into a career as a Quality Analyst.  It ended up being a natural fit for me as a lifetime of playing video games has given me a love for critical thinking and problem solving and breaking things.   
			</p>
			<p class="aboutme">
				Outside of work, I spend my time playing board games, watching bad movies, and attending various pop culture conventions across the country.
